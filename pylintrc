# Reasons disabled:
# locally-disabled - it spams too much
# duplicate-code - it's annoying
# unused-argument - generic callbacks and setup methods create a lot of warnings
# too-many-* - are not enforced for the sake of readability
# too-few-* - same as too-many-*
# no-else-return - I don't see any reason to enforce this. both forms are readable
# no-self-use - stupid and only annoying
# unexpected-keyword-arg - doesn't allow for use of **kwargs, which is dumb
